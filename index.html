              <h2>Who am I ?</h2>
              <p>
                My name is Anıl Furkan Embel. I am 25 years old and I was born
                in Turkey. I completed my high school education at Kuleli
                Military High School. Between 2017 and 2021, I studied
                Industrial Engineering at the University of Turkish Aeronautical
                Association and graduated from my department. During my
                bachelor education, I participated in 2 Erasmus+ projects
                in Romania and Poland.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the graduation, I managed Shopify, Amazon and Etsy
                e-commerce pages for 1 year in an American company and provided
                support to the company on issues such as remote data analysis
                and SEO. I realized that I have an interest in data analysis and
                my advanced communication skills and my interest in visual
                fields were effective in my decision to specialize in Data
                Analysis. I received an intensive 7-month boot camp training in
                Data Science. I did my internship in this field in a Belgian
                company in Brussels.
              </p>
			  <p>As for my hobbies, I was involved in athletics in high school and I love daily running. I also played American football as an amateur on the University team and I enjoy watching NFL games. I have a small YouTube channel with 9900 subscribers
			  </p>
			  <p>In the future, I plan to produce projects in data science and business and further develop my skills in these areas.

                I'm a data analysis consultant at an European travel agency. my mission is to help the company find business insights from their data that will help them grow their business.

				To do so, I will create a dashboard! What is important to include in the dashboard? Ideally, this dashboard would help travel agents make recommendation to travellers on the best food destination for their trips across Europe.
